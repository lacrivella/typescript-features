examples of different types in typescript and why we use them

##What is a Type
**Type** is an easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has.

**Type annotations**: code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to. Basically we, the developers, tell Typescript the type

**Type inferenece**: Typescript trie to figure out what type of value a variable refers to. Typescript guesses the type.
